Tokyo Metropolitan Government Building: This skyscraper offers panoramic views of Tokyo from its free observation decks. The design blends traditional Japanese architecture with modern influences, creating a visually soothing experience.

- At 202 meters high, the Tokyo Metropolitan Government Building is one of the tallest buildings in Tokyo and provides breathtaking views of the city.
- The building was designed by architect Kenzo Tange, who also designed the Hiroshima Peace Memorial Park. His design is influenced by both traditional Japanese styles and modern architectural trends.
- Sketched outlines of famous Tokyo landmarks can be found on the windows of the observation decks, showing where each one lies in the sprawling cityscape.
- The building houses the Tokyo Metropolitan Government which administers the 23 wards of Tokyo, as well as multiple cities, towns, and villages in Western Tokyo. 
- The North Tower of the building contains a restaurant on the 45th floor where you can enjoy a meal with panoramic views of Tokyo.
- Visitors of the building are often seen peering through high-powered binoculars on the observation deck to get a closer look at specific landmarks, or capturing photos of Tokyo's panoramic cityscape.
- A pleasant experience associated with a visit can be starting at Shinjuku Station, one of the world's busiest railway stations, on a crisp morning. Your friendly tour guide walks you through busy crowds as soft-spoken instructions guide everyone to the Toei Oedo Line. Once settled in, the excitement heightens as the automated announcement notifies that the next stop is Tochomae, the closest station to the Tokyo Metropolitan Government Building. Upon exiting the station, you are struck by the impressive sight of the towering structure piercing the clouds, a symbolic representation of Tokyo's vibrant urban culture. You spend a few moments taking in the view before following the guide through landscaped gardens and modern sculptures, arriving at the building's entrance.

Hamarikyu Gardens: A calming oasis in the bustling city, this Edo-era garden invites transquil reflection with its serene pond, beautiful teahouse, and seasonal flowers. The surrounding skyscrapers provide a stunning contrast to the ancient aesthetics of the garden.

- Hamarikyu Gardens were built during the Edo period by the Tokugawa Shogunate, originally serving as a feudal lord's Tokyo residence.
- The garden is a "circuit style" garden, which represents the landscapes of Japan through carefully curated nature scenes.
- It features some of the oldest pine trees in the city, some of which are about 300 years old.
- Unique to this garden is its tidal pond, which changes water level with the ebb and flow of Tokyo Bay.
- Possibly the most iconic spot in Hamarikyu Gardens is the Nakajima-no-Ochaya teahouse, situated right in the center of the pond. Here, visitors can enjoy traditional Japanese matcha tea and sweets.
- Visitors around the garden can often be seen walking and taking pictures, having picnics under the cherry blossom trees, or contemplating the reflective beauty of the shard-shaped skyscrapers in the tea-infused tranquility of the tea house.
- A pleasant experience would be to arrive at the gardens just as the morning sun paints the towering cityscape in hues of gold. The garden's entrance is a few minutes' walk from Shiodome Station – a ride that your gregarious but soft-spoken tour guide makes enlightening by sharing tidbits about Tokyo's metro system and the upcoming nature spot. Upon entering from the bustling city into the serene garden, the welcome change of sounds – from trains and car horns to the rustling leaves, chirping birds, and gentle waters – adds a uniquely calming character to the place.
