Park Guell: A masterpiece of renowned architect Antoni Gaudi, this public park system brims with beautiful gardens and architectonic elements that are artistically stunning. Your student guide's double major will come in handy as they deftly navigate you through its rich history and artistry.

- Conceived as a housing estate project by entrepreneur Eusebi Güell, the project was unsuccessful which later led to the development of this park.
- The park showcases Gaudi’s creative genius as it integrates his works with natural shapes and curves of the landscape.
- The serpentine bench in the park offers a panoramic view of Barcelona city below, a spot frequently used by visitors for photoshoots.
- The park is home to the famous 'El Drac' (The Dragon), a cheerful ceramic lizard that has become a symbol of Barcelona.
- Literary references to Park Guell often focus on its otherworldliness and fairy-tale ambiance. In Carlos Ruiz Zafón's "The Shadow of the Wind", he describes Barcelona's Gaudi buildings and their surroundings as "a city designed by a race of giants."
- A delightful nod to local cuisine during your visit might be enjoying a bocadillo (sandwich) or fresh churros con chocolate from a nearby street vendor.
- Typical activities visitors partake in include sketching or painting the mosaics, sunbathing on the main terrace, or enjoying a picnic in one of the green areas. 
- A charming moment with your guide could be standing together at the highest point in the park. While they explain Gaudi's vision of blending built environment with nature, you marvel at the panoramic view of Barcelona, appreciating the vision and labor that went into shaping this piece of art and history.
