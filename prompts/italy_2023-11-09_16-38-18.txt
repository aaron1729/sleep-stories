Colosseum: An iconic symbol of Rome, this ancient amphitheater used for gladiatorial contests and public spectacles in the Roman Empire. Exploring around the monument by Vespa gives you a history-rich experience.

- Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II, during her 2000 visit to the Colosseum said, "Among the many great historical monuments with which your country is so richly endowed, none is more eloquent of Italy's ancient civilizations than the Colosseum."
- The Colosseum used to host gladiatorial contests, mock sea battles, animal hunts, and mythological drama plays.
- The colossal structure has a capacity to accommodate approximately 50,000 spectators.
- The architectural design of the modern-day stadiums is influenced by the Colosseum's seating arrangements.
- The restaurants surrounding the Colosseum are famous for serving "Cacio e Pepe," a traditional local dish made with pasta, Pecorino Romano cheese, and pepper.
- After successfully parking your Vespa in the dedicated spaces near the monument, taking a moment to behold the majestic Colosseum in the warm Italian sunshine gives you a surreal feeling of walking back in time. Standing at the spot where Romans cheered on gladiators thousands of years ago adds an indescribable sense of wonder to your visit.

Ponte Vecchio: A medieval stone closed-spandrel segmental arch bridge over the Arno River, in Florence. Known for the shops that are built along it, it's a perfect place to ride your Vespa and enjoy the charm of Florence.

- It was believed to be first built in the Roman times and it was the only bridge across the Arno in Florence until 1218.
- The bridge has always hosted shops and merchants who displayed their goods on tables before their premises. Butchers initially occupied the shops but today the premises are jewelers, art dealers and souvenir sellers.
- The bridge first appears in a document of 996 AD which mentions the damage it suffered from a flood, making it the oldest bridge in Florence.
- While you're there, it is a must to try the Florentine accompaniment dish, Fagioli allâ€™uccelletto, a Tuscan bean dish cooked with sage and tomatoes. Nearby restaurants serve this iconic dish, best enjoyed with a glass of Tuscan wine.
- Riding a Vespa across the Ponte Vecchio, you feel the sun on your skin and the wind in your hair as the picturesque sight of Florence surrounds you. You hear the chatter of people negotiating with jewelers, the sounds of the lapping water of the River Arno below, and smell the tempting scents emanating from nearby restaurants. You may even stop mid-way to soak in the charming view or buy a souvenir at one of the many small shops dotting the bridge.
