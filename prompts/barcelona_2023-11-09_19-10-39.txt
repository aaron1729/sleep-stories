Park Güell: This UNESCO World Heritage site designed by Antoni Gaudí offers views of the city from beautiful, colorful mosaic-covered terraces. Your knowledgeable guide will share its history and the details of Gaudí's unique vision.

- The park was commissioned by Eusebi Güell, a businessman who admired the work of Antoni Gaudí.
- Construction took place between 1900 and 1914, housing a series of gardens and architectural elements in Gaudí's characteristic style.
- The park was originally intended to be a housing estate, but only two houses were ever built, one of which Gaudí himself lived in for a while.
- In "The Shadow of the Wind", Carlos Ruiz Zafon wrote, "We walked round the paths of Park Güell, among couples in love with their love and their selfie sticks, and alleged tourists lured in by genius turned up to eleven."

Typically, while at Park Güell, one can enjoy a picnic with traditional Spanish tortilla de patatas (potato omelet), some local cheese, and a bottle of cava.
