Central Park: A lush and calming oasis in the middle of the concrete jungle, offering peace and tranquility to locals and tourists alike. Your open-top bus tour stops here, allowing you to enjoy the beautiful scenic views.

- Central Park is the most visited urban park in the United States.
- Many iconic movie scenes have been filmed here including "Home Alone 2," "Elf," and "Enchanted."
- The park opened in 1857, making it over 160 years old.
- The dedication inscription of the Literary Walk?s statue of William Shakespeare reads: "There is not monument dedicated to the memory of a writer of like eminence that would insult the memory of Shakespeare. If we could build a monument high enough to reach the stars, it would be insufficient to express our high estimate of his genius; George Bancroft."
- A common dining experience in Central Park is having a picnic by the lake or dining at one of the park's restaurants such as The Loeb Boathouse.
- Other people in the park might be seen jogging, cycling, rowing boats, feeding the birds, or simply lounging on the grass.
- An experience you might have is listening to your guide, a man with roots as deep as the oldest trees in the park, explaining in his thick Brooklyn accent about the Park's history and significance, while you enjoy the cool breeze and distant city sounds from atop the open-top bus. Afterward, you might choose to rent a rowboat and take a leisurely row around the lake or visit the Strawberry Fields Memorial dedicated to John Lennon. Few experiences match the unique combination of urban and natural beauty found in Central Park.
