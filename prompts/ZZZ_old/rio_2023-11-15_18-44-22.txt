- Made primarily of reinforced concrete and covered in a mosaic of soapstone, the latter which was chosen for its enduring qualities and its light color.
- The statue was struck by lighting in 2008 and repairs were made, including making the statue lightning proof.
- The famous phrase "Rio de Janeiro continues beautiful" is often attributed to Christ the Redeemer, despite it just being a popular song.
- Dining at the Café do Bom, which serves traditional Brazilian dishes, is a popular occurrence after a tour of the statue.
- Visitors often take photographs with the statue, with many trying to mimic its iconic outstretched arms pose.
- On your way to the statue, your friendly driver might point out the different neighborhoods and sights you can see from the mountain, giving a brief history as he goes, and when you reach the statue, he'll help take the perfect picture of you with this monumental piece of art and architecture, all the while quietly and rightfully proud of his city's treasured landmark.

Jardim Botânico (Botanical Garden): A tranquil oasis in the city, this garden is home to over 6,000 indigenous and exotic species of plants.

- Founded in 1808 by King John VI of Portugal, the garden was initially for the acclimatization of spices such as nutmeg, pepper, and cinnamon.
- The Avenue of Royal Palms is a highlight. These 134 giant palm trees were all grown from a single plant and give the garden its distinctive look.
- Amazonian plants that would not survive the climate of Rio are housed in an impressive glasshouse.
- Visitors frequently observe various species of monkeys playing among the trees, as well as multicolored butterflies and birds.
- Buying a ticket at the entrance is a pleasing experience in itself, as your driver shares his knowledge of the park's history and you see the lush gateway to the garden.
- Inside the park, you can find a restaurant where you can try some local Brazilian dishes, such as feijoada, a black bean stew with pork, served with white rice, farofa (toasted cassava flour mixture), and orange slices.
- Visitors can often be spotted strolling around the pathways, pointing out and taking pictures of the exotic plants and bird species.
- One popular activity is laying out a blanket by the Fountain of the Muses and having a picnic under the gentle sun. This scene provides a quiet and peaceful ambience apart from the city's usual hustle and bustle.
- After walking around all day, it feels good to sit back in the plush leather seats of the limousine, slowly savoring the distant sound of a stream flowing through the gardens, as seen in the dim light of the dying day. The driver might share a knowing smile through the rear-view mirror, reminding you how pleasant it is to explore such tranquil refuges in the heart of the city.

Museum of Tomorrow: A science museum with futuristic architecture, this place explores the possibilities for the future of our planet in a peaceful, thoughtful, and non-confrontational manner.

- The Museum of Tomorrow was designed by the renowned Spanish architect Santiago Calatrava and was opened to the public in 2015.
- It's established in the Porto Maravilha urban regeneration area of Rio de Janeiro, a project to transform the city's waterfront district.
- Within the museum, visitors engage with a mix of science, art, and technology that explores the 'Anthropocene' – the new geologic time period defined by human impact on Earth's ecosystems.
- The main exhibition is divided into five main areas: Cosmos, Earth, Anthropocene, Tomorrow and Us. 
- It also houses temporary exhibits and a lively events program that attracts locals and tourists alike.
- Visitors can head upstairs to the museum's restaurant, enjoying authentic Brazilian food with stunning views of Guanabara Bay and the city beyond, like feijoada (a black bean stew with pork), acarajé (deep-fried balls of black-eyed pea dough filled with vatapá, a paste made from shrimp, bread, coconut milk, finely ground nuts and palm oil) and a caipirinha, Brazil’s national cocktail. 
- The museum has interactive touch screens where visitors can take quizzes and tests about their lifestyle and the environment. Hence, other people might be seen engaging with these interactive displays, taking selfies with the futuristic structures, or simply lounging nearby with a book.
- Arriving by limousine, it would be a delightful experience being greeted by your driver who ushers you into the Museum, describes the structure, and recommends that you take a moment to appreciate the stunning architecture and the waterfront's panoramic view. The driver might share personal anecdotes about bringing his own family to explore the exhibitions in the past. His presence adds a layer of personal connection to the futuristic and immersive experience.
