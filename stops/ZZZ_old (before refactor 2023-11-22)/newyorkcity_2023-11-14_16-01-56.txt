Central Park: Winding paths lead you through lush landscapes, an urban oasis in the heart of New York City where serenity meets spectacular views. An open-top bus tour brings you right to the heart of it.

- Central Park is one of the most filmed locations in the world, featured in many films such as "Home Alone 2", "When Harry Met Sally", and "Breakfast at Tiffany's".
- It was first opened in 1857, on 778 acres of city-owned land, and later expanded to its current size of 843 acres.
- The park features various landscapes, including meadows, forests, bodies of water, and architectural wonders, one of them being the Bethesda Terrace and Fountain.
- 'Catcher in the Rye' by J.D Salinger, a classic American novel, frequently references Central Park as the protagonist wanders the city.
- You won't go hungry as you walk through the park - many hot dog stands and pretzel vendors line the paths, offering quintessential New York quick bites.
- Activities you might see in the park include jogging, walking dogs, picnicking, and most famously, boating in the Central Park Lake.
- In your open-top bus tour, you will bask in the warm sunshine and feel the gentle breeze of the park as your Brooklyn-accented guide tells you stories of the park's history and how it has evolved over generations. The guide's passion for the city and its heritage will be contagious, and you'll find yourself captivated by tales of famous visitors, notable events, and fascinating park trivia. In between stories, you might even spot a few native bird species as you pass by The Ramble, a wooded area considered a birdwatcher's paradise. After the bus ride, switching to the Metro will give you a more local feel of the city's hustle and bustle, showing you a contrast yet harmonious coexistence between New York's urban energy and Central Park's tranquil refuge.
