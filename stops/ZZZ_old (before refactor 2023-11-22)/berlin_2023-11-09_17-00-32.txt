Brandenburg Gate: This iconic 18th-century neoclassical monument is a symbol of unity and peace in Berlin, providing visitors with a glimpse into Germany's complicated history.

- The Brandenburg Gate was built between 1788 and 1791 during the reign of Friedrich Wilhelm II.
- It was modeled on the Acropolis in Athens and built by Prussian architect Carl Gotthard Langhans.
- Once a symbol of division between East and West Berlin during the Cold War, the gate now embodies German unity.
- Highly related to Berlin's history, it saw major events like the Nazis' seizing power in 1933, when they celebrated a torchlight procession through the gate.
- A popular, heart-warming sight at Brandenburg Gate is seeing excited visitors who've just disembarked from the nearby U-Bahn (subway) station, eagerly rushing towards the structure. The subway journey to the gate is also an experience - looking at maps, listening to the announcements for the "Brandenburger Tor" station, and stepping out to see the monument framed by the Berlin sky.
- Indulge in a traditional Bratwurst from a local vendor near the gate.
