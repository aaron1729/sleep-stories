Vizcaya Museum and Gardens: A stunning Italian Renaissance-style villa and its surrounding gardens that teleports you to Italy without leaving the heart of Miami.

- Vizcaya Museum and Gardens was built in the early 20th century by industrialist James Deering, co-founder of International Harvester.
- Its architecture was inspired by various Italian Renaissance villas and estates. Over 1,000 craftsmen and artisans were employed in its creation.
- Now a National Historic Landmark, the home includes 34 rooms arranged around a central courtyard, filled with 15th to 19th-century furniture, tapestries, paintings, and decorative arts.
- The gardens are internationally renowned for their beauty, featuring elements of Italian and French design with subtropical woodland landscape.
- The estate's swan emblem is inspired by the novel "The Swan", an American novel set in Miami that was also later turned into a movie featuring Grace Kelly.
- A visit to Vizcaya isn't complete without stopping at the Caf√© and Shop where you can enjoy panini, salads, and scrumptious pastries with a beautiful view of the gardens.
- Upon arrival in your flashy red convertible, the first sight of the villa is breathtaking as the stunning property provides a stark contrast to the modern Miami skyline; It's like stepping back in time. The lush greenery around makes you feel as though you've been transported to another era. Parking up, you take a stroll along the manicured gardens, spotting orchids and snapping photos. It's an invigorating experience, full of natural beauty and striking architecture.
