art style: Art Nouveau

description: Art Nouveau is an international style of art, architecture, and applied art, especially the decorative arts, that was most popular between 1890 and 1910. Known for its organic, flowing lines and elegant form, Art Nouveau takes inspiration from the natural world and crafts sinuous curves reminiscent of plants and flowers. Illustrating Berkeley with an Art Nouveau twist could emphasize the city's connection to nature and its ecological consciousness. The decorative elements of Art Nouveau could frame iconic Berkeley landmarks such as the Sather Tower (Campanile) or the UC Berkeley campus, with its natural landscape seamlessly blending into stylized floral or vine-like borders. The sophisticated and ornamental qualities of Art Nouveau would bring out the city's elegance and historical charm, offering a visual narrative that highlights Berkeley's intellectual and natural beauty.

art style: Watercolor

description: Watercolor is a painting method in which the paints are made of pigments suspended in a water-based solution. It is known for its transparency, delicacy, and ability to capture subtle nuances of light and color. The gentle and fluid nature of watercolor makes it perfect for illustrating the historic and poetic essence of London, England. This technique could be used to depict the soft hues of a rainy London day, the grandeur of the Houses of Parliament as they overlook the Thames, or the quaint charm of streets lined with Victorian houses. Watercolor illustrations could convey the atmospheric moods of the city, from the bustling markets of Camden to the serene spaces of Hyde Park. The interplay of light and color inherent to this style would beautifully capture the cityâ€™s dynamic mix of history and modernity, creating evocative and dreamlike imagery.
