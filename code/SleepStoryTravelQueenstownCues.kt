Encompassing over one point two million hectares, the park offers an awe-inspiring view of nature's creativity—a convergence of steep cliffs, dense rainforests, and waterfalls that seem to pour directly from the heavens." /
    "Here, the epic walks like the Milford, Kepler, and Routeburn Tracks summon the daring and the peaceful alike, winding through scenes that defy imagination." /
    "Dating back over one hundred thousand years, the glaciers that once carved through this landscape have left behind deep fjords, the park's majestic namesake. In Milford Sound, boat tours navigate through the mirror-like waters as seals lounge on sun-heated rocks and penguins zip through the currents." /
    "Aboard these vessels, you find yourself enthralled by the soaring heights of Mitre Peak, feeling the cool mist of the waterfalls as their powerful sound reverberates against granite walls, the tunes of the cascades joining the concert of wildlife in a celebration of pristine beauty.",

This fortress of jagged peaks forms an arresting skyline, with each outline shaped by the relentless creativity of glaciers and the profound movements of the earth's crust over countless eras." /
    "These imposing towers have become an international beacon for winter sports enthusiasts thanks to the Remarkables Ski Area, which offers snow-covered inclines for skiing and snowboarding when the chill of winter settles over the landscape. In contrast, the warmth of summer turns these elevations into an arena for hikers and mountain bikers seeking adrenaline-charged climbs and descents." /

As the vessels navigate the serene waters, eyes are invariably drawn to the awe-inspiring presence of Mitre Peak, its form a natural spire reaching for the heavens." /

    "Emerging from the primordial majesty of Fiordland National Park, we once again cross paths with a storied vessel known for its century-long service on Lake Wakatipu - the TSS Earnslaw steamship. With a history stretching back over one hundred years, the steamship commenced its maiden voyage back in nineteen twelve and remains one of the few coal-fired passenger-carrying vessels still operating in the southern hemisphere." /
