In the soothing summer season, we find ourselves nestled within the natural wonders of Queenstown, New Zealand. The land of the Kiwis sings a beautiful song of rolling green mountains, undulating crystal-blue rivers, and peaceful lakes. The air is comfortably warm, not sweltering or stifling, but gentle, the kind of warmth that seeps softly through your skin, inviting you to fully relax and immerse yourself in the natural spectacle unfolding around you. 

Everywhere we look, Queenstown entices and woos us with her beauty. She is crowned by vibrant blue skies that stretch endlessly above, astoundingly clear, providing the perfect canvas for the radiant sun. The serenade of waves kissing the shoreline creates a soothing lullaby, blending harmoniously with the distant lush rustle of the wind teasing the treetops.

Today, we are brought even closer to this stunning scenery by embarking on a tranquil sightseeing tour using the region's unique mode of transportation - water taxis. These vessels smoothly cut through the azure surface of the Lake Wakatipu, giving us a unique and intimate perspective of the surrounding landscapes. On foot, we will lightly tread on the emerald hems of the forests and wander through the town’s charming bygone architecture. 

The beautiful marriage of man and nature here in Queenstown is soothing and inspiring. As we prepare for our excursion, we can't help but feel the quiet thrill of anticipation. We can already sense the beauty and serenity that await us, can almost feel the gentle hum of the boat beneath our feet and the soft summer breeze on our faces. The world around us is whispering an invitation to explore, to enjoy, to truly live in each breathtaking moment we are about to spend in Queenstown.

The water taxi gently comes to a halt at the pier, its engine quieting to a soft purr. As we disembark, our feet meet the welcoming planks of the jetty, welcoming us into the cherished sanctuary of the Queenstown Gardens. One of the oldest parks in New Zealand, the gardens have been lending peace and tranquility to both locals and visitors since they were opened in the late nineteenth century, back in eighteen sixty-seven.

The lush foliage of the park welcomes us like a comforting embrace even before we have stepped off the pier. An array of native and introduced tree species stands tall against the backdrop of the breathtaking mountains, the verdant leaves dancing gently in the summer breeze. Some of these trees, with their thickset trunks and extensive branches, bear a silent testimony to the passing of over a hundred years.

As we step onto the garden paths, a symbol catches our attention – a circular marker representing a disc golf course, one of New Zealand's first established in nineteen ninety-six, adds a touch of modern innovation to the age-old serenity of the gardens. A disc skims the air, thrown by a group of youths enjoying the sunny day, and disappears amidst the soothing green.

There's a natural harmony found in the winding trails of the gardens, where the footpath blends seamlessly into the verdant surroundings. Early morning joggers, with the rosy flush of activity on their faces, casually pass us. Their soft shoes against the gravel trails create a soothing rhythm, matching the gentle lapping of the lake's waves. The invigorating garden air fills our lungs, setting a calm tone for our adventuring day.

Nestled within the lush embrace of the gardens is a statue of a determined-looking man, his gaze long and thoughtful - William Rees. He is the founder of Queenstown, and his statue stands as a reminder of the city's origins amidst all this natural beauty which adds a deeper sense of connection to our exploration.

As we walk the winding paths, a picture-perfect spot by Lake Wakatipu beckons to us. A group of locals enjoys a picnic under the shade of an old tree, the sound of their quiet laughter mingles with the peaceful song of a Tui. We are inspired to follow their example, pulling out our freshly-prepared deli sandwiches from a local café. The delicious smell of our lunch mingles with the aroma of the surrounding vegetation, creating a unique blend that is both satisfying and comforting. As we savor our picnic by the calm waves of the lake, we can't help but feel content in the tranquil embrace of the Queenstown Gardens.

As we wrap up our tranquil time at the Queenstown Gardens, we embark again on our water taxi, the vessel humming back to life with a comforting rhythm. The immediate reward of our journey is the beautiful view that unfolds before us as the deep blue water of Lake Wakatipu opens up. As we move across the undulating waves, our destination, Mount Nicholas Station, peeks ever so slightly above the horizon. 

Cradled within a hundred thousand acres of pristine New Zealand beauty, Mount Nicholas Station is a living symbol of the country's rich past. The station’s relationship with this land stretches back to the mid-nineteenth century, to the year eighteen sixty, telling a tale of gold mining, rabbiting, and deer recovery in its earliest days. Recognized in twenty thirteen by the New Zealand Historic Places Trust for its historic significance, the station now stands not just as a flourishing high country working farm, but also a monument for times past. 

As we draw near, the expansive green and gold fields sloping up to the rugged mountain tops come into full view. The sight is breathtaking. A comforting scene that writes its own silent hymn, singing praises to Mother Nature and her pristine artwork. Our lungs fill with crisp, fresh air; a silent salute to the beauty that surrounds us.

Once we disembark, our senses are immediately greeted by the earthy aroma of the farm. Welcoming us concretely is an inviting activity - the shearing of sheep. Both locals and tourists alike are engaged in the delightful hustle and bustle of the station's operations. Some are receiving gentle, hands-on guiding by seasoned shearers, while others attentively observe, learning a vital part of the farm life.

With stomachs stirred by the morning's adventures, we decide to partake in one of the highlights of a Mount Nicholas visit - a farm-fresh BBQ Lunch. We find ourselves cherishing the succulent morsels of locally-raised fare. The flavourful merino lamb and hearty venison transport us to culinary delight. With each bite, we savour the authentic taste of Queenstown, the sprinkle of adventurous spirit that seems to echo in the mountains, and even in the humble farmland. 

After our satisfying lunch, we are eager to indulge closer with the nature around us. We find ourselves drawn towards the guided nature walks offered by the station, ready to dive in deeper into the serene communion that Queenstown's beauty inspires. Just as we begin our trail, a soft breeze lifts, brushing against our cheeks, possibly whispering the secrets of Mount Nicholas that we are about to uncover.

As we conclude our nature walk at Mount Nicholas Station, we get ready for another water adventure. This time our destination is considerably larger and richer in legends - New Zealand's third-largest lake known as Lake Wakatipu. The lake, with its distinctive lightning bolt shape, is as iconic as the myths that surround it. Maori lore speaks of its creation through the immolation of a giant named Matau, with his heart, still beating, causing a rhythmic 'tide' in the tranquil waters. The rhythmic pulse brings a unique lifelike lushness to the lake, animating its calm surface with gently rippling waves.

Launching our journey across the lake, the silent majesty of the Remarkables mountain range encircling the lake greets us. It is as though nature, in a stroke of artistic brilliance, created a perfect canvas for the mountains’ reflections. This picturesque scene has not only captivated the hearts of locals and tourists alike but has claimed a spot in popular culture as well. The stunning beauty of Lake Wakatipu, playing the role of the Lothlorien Forest, made a memorable appearance in Peter Jackson's widely adored "The Lord of the Rings" series.

As the water taxi glides gently over the crystal-blue waters, we note other visitors engaging in a dizzying array of activities - boating, kayaking, or even bravely bungee jumping over the lake. Such lively sights only seem to amplify the peaceful hum of the taxi as we sail further into the tranquil heart of the lake.

With the setting sun casting a golden hue over the serene environment, we indulge in a quintessential lakeside experience. Delectable green-lipped mussels, a treasure of New Zealand's seafood offerings, create a rich culinary memory. Each mouthful is a feast of flavors, enhanced by the stunning views of the lake stretching out toward the serene sunset.

As we continue our journey throughout the lake, the moment becomes a lullaby, a gentle cradle of comforting waves, friendly laughter from nearby boats, and the occasional soothing cries of birds overhead. On board the water taxi, we feel a deep sense of tranquility, a restful peace that captures the essence of Lake Wakatipu. With the vivid array of colors cast by the fading day cascading on its surface, the lake proves to be not merely a body of water, but a living story, a breathtaking spectacle bearing the tranquil rhythms of Queenstown nested within its heart.

Our water taxi once more gently cleaves through the undulating waves of Lake Wakatipu, this time setting course towards another encounter with nature's bounty. Our destination now is the Sigma Olive Estate, a place known for nourishing something precious - the heritage of centuries-old olive trees, a living link to the past cultivated by Greeks and Romans in their storied histories. 

How nature intertwines itself with tradition here is nothing short of enchanting. The estate consciously adopts sustainable farming methods, staying true to the roots of olive oil production. The olives are stone-pressed in a rhythm as old as time, an homage to the traditional ways which imbues a sense of profound respect for nature's gifts.

Stepping off the water taxi onto the sun-kissed soil of the estate brings forth an unexpected delight. The grove's air is thick with the fresh scent of olive leaves, an intoxicating perfume of tranquility. Visitors meander through the lush olive tree lines, camera in hand, trying to encapsulate the timeless beauty of the grove into a single, fleeting image. Meandering past the myriad of green, our eyes are inevitably drawn to the estate's honey production site - the on-site bee hives. The tiny, bustling workers add a rhythmic hum to the estate's peaceful serenity, reminding us of nature's ceaseless symphony, untouched by time's relentless march.

Having soaked in the scenic solitude, it's time to embark on a culinary journey of evolution. The estate offers an immersive olive oil tasting, each variety of their extra virgin olive oil carrying a unique note. Locally sourced bread and a selection of dishes accompany the olive oils, creating an orchestra of flavors that dance on our taste buds. The experience is enriched as we learn about the estate's honey - another offering from this land of sustainability. Its taste varies subtly with each new season, as the bees collect nectar from different blossoms. As we savor the taste of honey, fresh bread, and world-class olive oil, it feels as though we are engaging in a silent dialogue with the serene landscapes around us.

Finally, the opportunity to buy fresh olive oil and honey straight from the estate adds a joyous note to our visit. We get to take a piece of this harmonious estate back with us, a token to remember this peaceful day. A soft anticipation fills us as we think of the savory dishes prepared with Sigma’s olive oil and the comforting sweetness of the honey drizzled on a piece of toast. Still, our journey here isn't complete. As we cautiously pack these treasures into our bags, we look forward to the next stop in our gentle exploration of Queenstown.

Leaving the luxurious Sigma Olive Estate behind, we journey towards a different embrace of nature. Our destination is the Kiwi and Birdlife Park, an indigenous wildlife haven that has been cradling New Zealand's unique fauna since its establishment in nineteen eighty-six. This family-owned park houses more than twenty diverse species of native animals and birds, including the elusive Kiwi bird, a treasure that's distinctly New Zealand.+

Upon our arrival, it becomes clear that the purpose of this park extends beyond just observation. Informative presentations by knowledgeable park rangers offer us a chance to learn about these fascinating creatures in depth. Each word they utter about the kiwi bird and its companions enhances our appreciation of the delicate balance that exists within nature.

One of the most anticipated moments is our visit to the nocturnal house, a sort of sui generis night-in-day experience. In this unusual setting, amid hushed whispers and the faint rustling of nocturnal creatures, we get our first glimpse of the kiwi bird. Seeing this unique bird, found nowhere else on Earth, can be a profoundly touching moment for any traveler. Its peculiar, slightly comical appearance, marked by a long beak and hairy feathers, contrasts sharply with its enigmatic allure, making the sighting even more exceptional. 

But there's more to the park than just the kiwi. The park unveils to us a plethora of creatures such as the smarty-faced Kea, the vigorous New Zealand Falcon, and the demure Morepork Owl. Each one confidently fills its role in the intricate ballet of the ecosystem.

To make our visit more fulfilling, the Kiwi Conservation Experience offers a hands-on opportunity to support the tireless preservation work. Aided by the dedicated staff, we have the chance to contribute however we can to maintaining the health and happiness of these beautiful creatures.

As the day gradually eases, our food cravings lead us to nearby eateries offering authentic New Zealand dishes. Be it the traditional Maori hangi or a simple yet satisfying fish and chips, our palates are treated to the comforting flavors of local cuisine.

Permitting the taste of the food to linger, we board our water taxi, pursuing a gentle journey back to the town center. As the boat cuts through the water, ducks playfully chase us, seeming to enjoy the gentle splashing. The beautiful view of Queenstown, slowly receding in the distance, is enough to steal our breaths away. The quiet spectacle, coupled with the gentle lapping of waves against the boat, brings our day to a soothing close.

Leaving the serene waters behind, our next destination sparks a hint of adventure and wonder. The water taxi, a faithful companion throughout our journey, now brings us closer to the magnificent Queenstown Hill, known to the local Māori population as Te Tapu-nui. We can feel the land rising beneath us – a grand stage for our anticipated hike.

As we get closer, we notice other enthusiastic hikers, here for the same purpose. Their light-hearted banter and shared excitement add to the journey’s spirit, fostering a sense of camaraderie that only shared prediction of an adventure can inspire. The sight before us is of breathtaking beauty, capturing the essence of Queenstown with the sparkling blue Lake Wakatipu nestled at the foot of the Hill. The sunlight's shimmering dance on the water's surface has a cinematic quality, as if nature itself is putting on a spectacular show.

Finally, we disembark and set foot on the trail that leads uphill. It's a refreshing contrast from our water-based experiences - our feet against the gravel, the sound of our steady breath paired with the soft rustling of the leaves. The entire walk up to the summit and back is expected to span between two and three hours – plenty of time to soak in the majesty of the surroundings.

A modern sculpture named the Basket of Dreams comes into view as we near the top. It's a reminder of Queenstown's multicultural society, standing proud and strong under the vast blue sky, a symbol of unity and shared dreams. It's a popular spot for photo opportunities, and we join in, capturing the symbol against the majestic backdrop of the lake and mountains.

Upon reaching the summit, we are met with a tranquil spot, perfect for a picnic break. The panoramic view across the beautiful town, the mesmerizing radiance of Lake Wakatipu, and the magnificent presence of the mountains around us is a sight that touches our hearts. It’s here that we lay down our blanket, pull out our simple yet fulfilling picnic sandwiches made from local ingredients, and let the spectacle of our surroundings offer us the perfect dining experience.

With each bite of the sandwich, mingled with our shared laughter and the serene ambiance around us, this breathtaking expanse etches its special place in our memories. This intimate connection with Queenstown Hill, combined with the immense solitude of the peak, lends a profound depth to our day of gentle exploration.

Returning from the heights of Queenstown Hill, our water taxi now journeys towards a different kind of mesmerizing beauty - Lake Hayes. Known as the mirror lake, its expansive surface holds a breathtaking secret - the most extraordinary reflections of New Zealand's landscapes.

Named after prominent local run holder Donald Hay in the eighteen hundreds, Lake Hayes has since reflected not just the mountains and trees, but also the changing times and the quiet rhythm of the local people's lives. Today, it is a refuge of peace, a living canvas that has filled the work of contemporary artists like famed local, Graham Brinsley.

As we arrive closer to the picturesque lake, we notice a loop track encircling the water - a path well-trodden by walkers and joggers delighting in the beautiful views that accompany their exercise. Others have chosen different ways to enjoy the day at Lake Hayes, from families hosting lively picnics to cyclists leisurely pedaling around the track, to bird watchers in quiet contemplation.

For us, our anticipation builds as we prepare to join in the heartfelt enjoyment. The smell of buttery fairy bread, a simple yet surprisingly delightful Kiwi treat sprinkled with colorful 'hundreds and thousands', wafts through the air from a nearby family picnic. We cannot help but feel inspired as we set up our own picnic spot, the crisp destination bread and local cheese from our basket somehow taste richer in this tranquil setting.

As we savor our meal, our eyes are drawn to the unique spectacle of Lake Hayes. The pristine, mirror-like surface of the lake reflects the regal mountains, the surrounding verdant trees, and the deep cerulean blue of the vast sky above. It’s an image so perfectly mirrored, it feels as if two worlds reside here - one on land and the other under the tranquil water surface.

Taking the tranquillity a step further, we spot the swift flight of the native diving duck - the New Zealand scaup, and the elegant Australasian crested grebe over the silent surface of the lake. Their graceful flight pattern ripples the calm mirror surface of the lake, adding a dynamic touch to the serene landscape.

The pretty-as-a-picture scene of Lake Hayes, filled with joyous activities and untouched flora and fauna, radiates a soothing calm, inviting us to simply sit back and fill our senses with its magnificence. Each passing moment here at Lake Hayes feels like a gentle pause, a beautiful meditative whisper in our fascinating journey through Queenstown.

Others have chosen different ways to enjoy the day at Lake Hayes, from families hosting lively picnics to cyclists leisurely pedaling around the track, to bird watchers in quiet contemplation.

For us, our anticipation builds as we prepare to join in the heartfelt enjoyment. The smell of buttery fairy bread, a simple yet surprisingly delightful Kiwi treat sprinkled with colorful 'hundreds and thousands', wafts through the air from a nearby family picnic. We cannot help but feel inspired as we set up our own picnic spot, the crisp destination bread and local cheese from our basket somehow taste richer in this tranquil setting.

As we savor our meal, our eyes are drawn to the unique spectacle of Lake Hayes. The pristine, mirror-like surface of the lake reflects the regal mountains, the surrounding verdant trees, and the deep cerulean blue of the vast sky above. It’s an image so perfectly mirrored, it feels as if two worlds reside here - one on land and the other under the tranquil water surface.

Taking the tranquillity a step further, we spot the swift flight of the native diving duck - the New Zealand scaup, and the elegant Australasian crested grebe over the silent surface of the lake. Their graceful flight pattern ripples the calm mirror surface of the lake, adding a dynamic touch to the serene landscape.

The pretty-as-a-picture scene of Lake Hayes, filled with joyous activities and untouched flora and fauna, radiates a soothing calm, inviting us to simply sit back and fill our senses with its magnificence. Each passing moment here at Lake Hayes feels like a gentle pause, a beautiful meditative whisper in our fascinating journey through Queenstown.

Our serene journey continues as we bid farewell to the stunning beauty of Lake Hayes. We return to our trusted water taxi, setting our sights now on the Shotover River. Historically renowned, this river once sang songs of the gold rush in the late nineteenth century. It was not just any gold-bearing river, but one of the world's richest, an allure communicated in the Maori name for it - "Kimihia", meaning "seek and you shall find". 

As we glide along the river, we can almost feel the echo of the past, the hustle and bustle of those in pursuit of precious golden treasures. It's a blissful moment that makes us appreciate the serene vibes the river exudes today. We're connected to this intriguing history through literary gems like "Recollections of a Gold Digger" by Vincent Pyke, where nostalgic tales of the Shotover River lie within.

Amid this depth of history, the present paints an equally wondrous picture. The river entices visitors with its fast-flowing waters, perfect for thrilling jet-boating adventures. Today, we observe the exhilarating rush of thrill-seekers zipping past us in their boats. On the climax of our calming journey, however, we appreciate the beauty of more serene activities as families and friends enjoy picnics along the riverbanks.

Gold has laid claim to the past, but the beauty of the Shotover River has paved its way into the future. As our taxi cruises down the river, the sun pours its golden hue onto the water's rippling surface, creating a mesmerizing spectacle. The radiant beams bounce off the water and gently kiss our skin, while the rich riverside flora adds a luscious green curtain to our scenic journey.

Feels like hunger striking a chord reminding us of planned cultural dining experiences around the river. Local eateries near the riverside serve traditional Maori dishes for us to savour, such as hearty Hangi, cooked in earth ovens. This authentic connection to the native culture and land heightens the taste of the meal even more.

Engrossed in the sensory delights offered by the Shotover River, we find ourselves in a gentle sway with these calm, yet vibrant, surroundings. As we continue to float on the tranquil depths of the river, it feels as ever we are a part of the Shotover's ongoing narrative, a tale enriched by history, nature, and the vivacious spirit of Queenstown.

Our journey across Queenstown’s many treasures leads us next to a remarkable piece of local history - the One Mile Power House. Regarded as the town’s first hydroelectric power station, it reminisces of times when the golden pulse of Queenstown throbbed most potently with the hum of the iconic gold dredges it powered.

Built as early as nineteen hundred and six, the power station symbolized a vibrant chapter in the story of renewable energy generation in New Zealand, continuously operating until the nineteen sixties. Today, its antique charm has been conserved in the form of a heritage museum, showcasing the power station’s significant role in Queenstown’s development.

Marveling at the rustic exterior of the power station, we feel a fresh sense of curiosity bubbling within us. Displaying the pioneering past of the town, the museum presents an intriguing time travel experience into the heart of the bygone era when the power station was in its full glory. Visitors around us share the same mesmerized expression; their voices, hushed but filled with awe, add a unique texture to the building’s silent narration of its own history.

While history keeps the adults engrossed in its allure, local delicacies attract both children and adults alike. A nearby dining spot entices us with the tantalizing aroma of pies and pastries - a true local favorite. The delicious morsels not only satiate our hunger but add another layer to our authentic Queenstown experience.

Having savored the tastes of Queenstown, we join our fellow visitors and take to the nearby walking and biking trails, eager to further explore the vibrant nature encircling us. The blend of energetic exploration and peaceful contemplation creates a soothing rhythm to our journey.

Returning back to our trusted water taxi, we cast a last reverent look at the One Mile Power House, its edifice glowing warmly setting against the backdrop of the fading sun. We begin to depart, leaving the shores behind yet again, but the magnificent history of the One Mile Power House remains etched in our hearts as an unforgettable chapter in our serene journey through Queenstown.

From the compelling history of the One Mile Power House, we now embark towards a different kind of fascination - the majestic beauty of Nature herself in the Remarkables Park. This verdant oasis is nestled at the base of the eminent Remarkable mountain range, one of the few in the world to hold the distinction of running directly north to south.

As we approach the park, a stunning spectacle unfurls before our eyes. The dynamic contrast of the lush greenery of the park set beside the rugged beauty of the Remarkables serves as a reminder of nature's diverse capabilities. These mountains, standing tall in their raw magnificence, have served as more than just geographical landmarks. They have been a muse for film makers, lending their enigmatic charm to many cinematic marvels, including the iconic Lord of the Rings trilogy.

Touching down at the park, we find ourselves amongst outdoor enthusiasts, their spirits illuminated by the all-encompassing beauty. The air is punctuated with merry laughter and the soft whispers of nature lovers alike. Families spreading out delightful picnic spreads, amateur hikers preparing for a trial up the inviting trails, and bird watchers with their binoculars trained towards the treetops fuse to create a vibrant tableau of togetherness.

A cherished component of this energized atmosphere wafts over from a nearby food truck, a familiar spot for park visitors. It draws us in, and soon we join the others with delicious traditional New Zealand meat pies in our hands. The savoriness of the pies is amplified by the sweeping grandeur around us, each bite making us feel closer to Queenstown's character.

Following our meal, a sense of grandiosity compels us to explore the space at our disposal. The park lends itself to gentle exploration where every tree and bush, guided by the brush of nature's hand, translates into an intimate bond with our surroundings.

At the end of our visit, we return to our trusty water taxi, each individual imparting a final, longing gaze at the rendezvous of green plains and towering mountains. As the taxi gently drifts away from the park, the iridescent waters of Lake Wakatipu play host to our lingering glances. The receding vista of Remarkables Park, juxtaposed against the approaching panorama of central Queenstown, promises further entrancing encounters in our tranquil exploration of this charming town.

Our wonder-filled exploration of Queenstown finds a new destination in Walters Peak, an operational high country sheep and deer station with remarkable views of Lake Wakatipu. Birthed during the gold rush in eighteen sixty, the station sprawls expansively across over forty thousand acres. It's a harmonious orchestra of mountains, rivers, lakes, and pastures, all contributing to a breathtaking panorama.

With a rich history entwining the landscape, Walters Peak has been a witness to the ingenious spirit of its people. It remembers celebrated Kiwi inventor Ernest Hayes, who once owned the station and used his innovative prowess to enhance agricultural equipment in the early twentieth century.

Arriving at Walters Peak, the high country farming demonstrations immediately pique our interest. We join other visitors watching the fascinating spectacle of sheep herding. There’s something soothing about the rhythmic movement of the flock under the watchful eye of the sheepdog. In another corner, wool spinning showcases the journey of raw wool transforming into a lovely, tangled web of threads, reminding us of the small wonders that everyday life holds.

In between these demonstrations, the Colonel's Homestead, an elegant estate within Walters Peak, opens its doors for a delightful dining experience. Our meal here is not just a barbecue lunch or dinner, it's an immersive culinary experience. We partake in succulent flavours perfectly complemented by a range of New Zealand wines, a spread that lets us truly taste the essence of the region.

The gelid charm of Walters Peak is not limited to its farming culture and food alone. It extends to the magnificent landscapes that offer boundless possibilities. Visitors participating in guided horse treks and cycling tours form a picturesque silhouette against the backdrop of the high country. We see them, faces aglow with the joy of exploration, as they discover the undiscovered.

Leaving on a high note, we board a historic steamship on Lake Wakatipu, the TSS Earnslaw, towards the next leg of our journey. Operation since the early twentieth century, the vessel is an emblem of Queenstown's rich past. As we glide on the aquamarine lake, the imposing mountains offer a majestic view, while the Walters Peak recedes into a memory, locked within our hearts.

Onboard the steamship, as we share stories and drinks with fellow travellers, there's an unmistakable bond of shared experiences, of beauty witnessed and memories created. An onboard pianist provides the soundtrack to our reminiscence — a playful melody that has us tapping our feet, energising our spirits for the fascinating adventures to come.

Departing from the delightful culinary memories at the Jacks Point Club House Restaurant, our exploration of Queenstown now invites us towards one of its most fascinating attractions - Queenstown's Underwater Observatory. It proudly holds the title as New Zealand's largest freshwater observatory, offering an unprecedented peek into the aquatic life of the Lake Wakatipu. 

This miracle of architecture, built in two thousand and seven as a response to the Town's growing tourist magnetism, is a window that merges two contrasting worlds. Like the frames of an enchanted painting, it presents a near-surreal experience of observing Brown Trout, Rainbow Trout, Salmon, and Eels as they glide silently through the water.

Our journey commences with the purchase of tickets at the KJet kiosk on the Main Town Pier. An air of anticipation sweeps over us as we prepare to board the smooth ferry of our water taxi, all set to skim across Lake Wakatipu's calm water. As our taxi whisks us towards the observatory, the wind whistles a soft lullaby in our ears, while the splendid mountain ranges surrounding Queenstown look on silently, resolute guardians of the Town’s tranquil spirit.

Stepping off the taxi, we descend beneath the lake's surface at the observatory, our eyes adjusting to the unique spectacle unfolding before us. It’s not every day that one gets to bear witness to the nuanced subtleties of underwater life; the observatory provides an ensemble of aquatic revelations. While it's mesmerizing to observe the diverse aquatic life, watching divers feeding the fish becomes a highlight of the escapade.

Equally enthralling, we catch a glimpse of the famous New Zealand Paua or abalone, crayfish, and even an octopus, each of them comfortably nestled within their natural habitat. As we marvel at the seamless blending of different marine lives cohabiting harmoniously, we wear the humble smiles of community. The Queenstown Underwater Observatory, a dance of life under the quiet lake surface, etches itself as a crucial beat in the pulse of our gentle journey through Queenstown.

On taking the water taxi from downtown Queenstown, our journey gives us a dazzling preview of the region’s natural beauty – a serene glide over Lake Wakatipu's shimmering blue surface. The radiant view of the Remarkables mountain range is as impressive as it is serene, while sightings of local water birds lend an unposed charm to the tranquil moments.

As we disembark, we switch from one mode of transport to another - a Gondola lift that carries us to the top of the Luge track. The changing panorama sweeps stunning views of Queenstown and Lake Wakatipu into our vistas. We find our hearts aflutter with a gentle excitement, the gentle uphill ride preparing us for the thrilling journey downhill that awaits. 

At the starting point, the delicious aroma of barbecued venison sausage from the outdoor grill tantalizes our senses. We succumb to the mouthwatering temptation, savouring each juicy bite as we take in the buzzing energy around us. 

At last, we lay our hands on the Luge carts, these ingenious creations offering a thrilling ride controlled entirely by us. The long and winding track: over one thousand six hundred meters of banked corners, tunnels, and dippers amidst breath-taking mountain scenery, appears both inviting and exhilarating.

As we zoom down the captivating descent, our hearts singing in tandem with the rhythm of our Luge carts, we observe fellow riders experiencing the same invigorating adventure. Each face mirrors an array of emotions, their exhilaration, and joy enhancing our collective ride into a symphony of shared thrill.

The Skyline Luge, with its captivating contrast of adrenaline-fueled thrill balanced beautifully against the spectacular view, marks itself as a euphoric chapter in our serene yet exciting exploration of Queenstown.
