ORIGINAL TEXT:

Our sightseeing tour continues as we approach the gorgeous enclave of Vernazza's harbor. Drifting into the bay, the vibrant houses nestled against the hillside come into view, their colorful facades reflecting upon the water like an artist's dreamy palette. The harbor embraces both the calm waters and the timeless architecture, unspoiled by the passage of centuries. Above, Doria Castle stands resolute, its cylindrical tower a relic of maritime defense and vigilance, casting long shadows over the boats that rock softly beneath.

For a moment, we turn our thoughts to the resilience of Vernazza, remembering when this very harbor was besieged by floods in 2011. We agree that the restoration, fueled by community strength and global compassion, has enabled the harbor to hold onto its idyllic charm, a gentle reminder of nature's power and human endurance.

Stepping off the boat, we wander around the waterfront, mingling with both visitors and locals alike. The air is sweet with the scent of salt and baked goods, and we soon find ourselves with a piece of fresh focaccia, its crusty exterior giving way to a fluffy interior, a savory delight that enhances our leisurely stroll. The sunset begins its descent, illuminating the sea and sky in warm, amber tones. We pause, sitting comfortably at the harbor's edge, allowing the sight of petite vessels bobbing and the sounds of lapping water to lull us into a state of sheer contentment, with this picturesque harbor enfolding us in its enduring serenity.
