ORIGINAL TEXT:

With tranquil visions of the Happoen Garden in our hearts, we board the Tokyo Metro Ginza line and continue towards our next destination. Our next stop is Ueno station, and from there, we journey into Ueno Park. Upon exiting the bustling station, our soft-spoken guide leads us through the thrumming streets, and we take a moment to absorb the sight of the impressive entrance gate to Ueno Park, the first public park in Japan, symbolizing a proud tradition dating back to 1873.

The hustle and bustle of the city slowly fades away as we step into the park's peaceful green expanse. Previously, these grounds belonged to the temple of Kan'ei-ji, our guide informs us, his voice a soothing counterpoint to the birdsong around us. Now, Ueno Park houses several significant museums and gloriously maintained gardens, making it a cultural and natural sanctuary nestled within the city. 

As we tread the park's walkways, ancient shrines and temples, such as Tosho-gu shrine and Kiyomizu Kannon temple, greet us intermittently. Their sacred aura and historic architecture cast a charm over us, a glimpse into time when the city was just taking root around these spiritual structures. We pause for a moment, letting the solemn beauty and the tales of time that are etched into the stone walls of these structures fill our hearts.

Ueno Park is renowned for its cherry blossom viewing parties, or hanami, our guide recounts, gesturing towards the cherry blossom trees that dot the landscape. With the sakura season still at its peak, we can witness the park wearing its most spectacular attire. Families, tourists, and locals are seen picnicking under the canopy of blossoms, their laughter merging with the soft rustle of cherry blossom petals showering down with the breeze.

The delicate petals falling from the sakura trees mirror a scene from Natsume Sōseki's 1906 novel 'Botchan.' The protagonist, Botchan, often mentions his leisurely walks in this very park. It is easy to envision the soothing atmosphere Botchan experienced more than a century ago, experiencing the same peaceful ambiance, the continuity between then and now echoing softly around us.

Amidst the picnickers and families, artists and nature lovers find their own quiet corners within the park. Some are sketching the beautiful natural scenery, while others feed the pigeons or row boats in the park's Shinobazu Pond, their tranquil activities further enhancing the serene atmosphere.

As we stroll past these peaceful scenes, our tour guide invites us to have our own picnic under the cherry blossom trees, revealing the compact bento boxes that he has carried for us. Savoring the sushi and sakura mochi, we celebrate the traditional hanami, the lush greenery, and the abundant blooms providing a stunning backdrop. With each bite, we relish not just the food but also the distinct cultural experience of Tokyo.
