"Chinese cubism" is not a widely recognized or established art style in the same vein as Pop Art, which has a very clear history and list of characteristics. However, I can provide a set of attributes that might combine elements typically found in Chinese art with the defining characteristics of Cubism to help guide DALL-E or any AI in creating illustrations in the envisioned "Chinese cubism" style.

Chinese Aesthetics: Chinese art is known for its elegant brushwork, use of calligraphy, delicate landscapes, historical themes, and scenes from nature, such as florals, birds, and mountains. Motifs often include dragons, phoenixes, bamboo, orchids, and lotus flowers, which are rich in symbolic meanings.

Cubist Features: Cubism, pioneered by Pablo Picasso and Georges Braque in the early 20th century, is an avant-garde art movement where objects are broken up and re-assembled in an abstracted form, highlighting their composite geometric shapes and depicting them from multiple viewpoints simultaneously.

Combining Elements for Chinese Cubism:

Geometric Interpretation: Apply the geometric abstraction of Cubism to Chinese subjects. Break down traditional Chinese landscapes, figures, and motifs into their geometric components and represent them in a fragmented, multi-perspective view.

Palette Choices: While traditional Chinese art features a more subdued color palette including blacks, whites, grays, and muted natural tones, for a cubist adaptation, you can consider using that palette more abstractly. You can also introduce bolder contrasting colors as seen in Cubist works to accentuate the geometric forms.

Brushwork Adaptation: Instead of the flowing, continuous brushstrokes typical in Chinese painting, replicate these strokes in a more angular, disjointed fashion consistent with the Cubist style. Think about how a calligraphy brushstroke might be stylized into a Cubist form.

Incorporation of Calligraphy: Chinese calligraphy is an art in itself, often imbued with philosophical or poetic meaning. Cubist renditions could fragment and incorporate calligraphic elements into the overall composition, creating a dialogue between text and image.

Balancing Symbolism: Ensure that the cultural and symbolic significance of traditional Chinese art elements is respected and retained, even when abstracting them. This might involve keeping the integrity of certain key elements or symbols within the fragmented Cubist portrayal.

Collage Technique: Cubism often involved the use of collage, mixing in different materials and textures. You could reflect this by visually introducing textures reminiscent of rice paper, silk, or other materials associated with Chinese art.

Fusion of Styles: Recognizing that there will be inevitable tension between the fluidity of traditional Chinese painting and the angularity of Cubist geometry, embrace this tension to create a harmonious yet challenging new style. Allow the natural curves of Chinese motifs to intersect with the harsh lines of Cubist geometry.

To guide DALL-E in creating this type of artwork, you might use prompts like:

"Create an illustration in the style of Chinese Cubism, featuring fragmented geometric shapes that represent a traditional Chinese landscape with mountains, trees, and a river, incorporating elements of calligraphy and a muted natural color palette with contrasting accents."

Or

"Generate an image in the style of Chinese Cubism, where a dragon is reimagined with angular lines and geometric forms, rendered in traditional ink wash colors augmented with bold Cubist color accents, maintaining the dragon's symbolic power."

Remember, "Chinese cubism" as a term may not be readily understood without this context since it's a hypothetical fusion style rather than an established historical movement.
