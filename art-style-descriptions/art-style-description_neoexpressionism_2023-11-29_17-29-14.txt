Neo-Expressionism is an art movement that emerged in the late 1970s and 1980s as a response to the minimalistic and conceptual art movements that had dominated the previous decades. It is characterized by a number of key elements that directly influence the creation of its artwork, which can guide the generation of prompts for DALL-E to create illustrations in this style:

Intense Emotion and Subjectivity: Neo-Expressionist art is known for its raw, emotional intensity. Artists in this movement sought to convey subjective experiences, personal feelings, and emotional responses. To echo this in DALL-E prompts, one might focus on evoking a sense of urgency, passion, or inner turmoil within the scenes or subjects depicted.

Vibrant, Expressive Color: Color in Neo-Expressionism is often used expressively, rather than descriptively. Vivid, sometimes jarring colors can dominate the canvas, creating a sense of drama or aggression. In creating prompts for DALL-E, specifying a palette with bold and unexpected color combinations can help to capture this aspect of Neo-Expressionism.

Dynamic, Gestural Brushwork: Artists used loose, vigorous, and often visible brush strokes, which can imbue the piece with a sense of movement and energy. For DALL-E, prompts could call for illustrations that look as if they were painted with quick, sweeping, and impulsive brushwork, emphasizing the gesture over precision.

Figurative and Symbolic Imagery: While it often focuses on the human figure, Neo-Expressionism doesn't shy away from distortion or exaggeration to convey emotion or comment on society. Prompts for DALL-E might include descriptions of figures with exaggerated proportions or features, and scenes that incorporate symbolic elements reflecting contemporary issues or personal narratives.

Rejection of Conventional Beauty: Unlike movements that emphasize harmony and balance, Neo-Expressionism often embraces a more raw and jarring aesthetic. When prompting DALL-E, asking for images that defy conventional standards of beauty and instead showcase rough, textured, or discomforting visuals can produce more authentic Neo-Expressionist results.

Return to Myth and History: Many Neo-Expressionists mined history, myth, and folklore for subject matter, imbuing their work with a sense of narrative depth. Illustrations could be prompted to include mythical creatures, historical scenes, or archetypal figures rendered through a modern, expressive lens.

Layering and Collage Techniques: Neo-Expressionist artists sometimes incorporated mixed media, layering various materials on the canvas to create depth and complexity. DALL-E prompts might call for images that appear to have a collage-like quality, combining different textures and materials.

Thick, Impasto Surfaces: The texture of Neo-Expressionist paintings is often as important as the visuals themselves, with thick, impasto paint application that stands out from the canvas. To simulate this, DALL-E prompts can request textures that suggest a heavy, tactile quality, as if the paint was applied liberally and sculpturally.

References to Art History and Contemporary Culture: Neo-Expressionists both revered and subverted art historical references and contemporary cultural icons in their work. Asking DALL-E to create images that reference or twist well-known art historical figures or motifs with a contemporary, expressive twist can be aligned with this tendency.

In summary, Neo-Expressionism is a style marked by its emotive power, dynamic execution, and often intense, sometimes jarring visual language. When creating prompts for DALL-E to generate artwork in this style, emphasize elements such as subjective emotion, vibrant and expressive color usage, gestural brushwork, figurative distortion, and the incorporation of history and narrative depth. Also, suggest a preference for a rough and tactile texture that departs from conventional beauty, and that includes layers and a collage-like appearance to amplify the Neo-Expressionist impact.
