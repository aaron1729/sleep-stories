Musée d'Orsay: Step back in time in this former railway station, now filled with vibrant art masterpieces from the mid 19th century to the early 20th century. Your guide will help you understand the background and significance of each work as you peacefully explore the museum's collections.

- The Musée d'Orsay is housed in the former Gare d'Orsay, a Beaux-Arts railway station built between 1898 and 1900.
- The museum holds mainly French art dating from 1848 to 1914, including paintings, sculptures, furniture, and photography.
- It houses the largest collection of impressionist and post-Impressionist masterpieces in the world, by painters including Monet, Manet, Degas, Renoir, Cézanne, Seurat, Sisley, Gauguin, and Van Gogh.
- Famous paintings include Whistler's Mother, The Starry Night, and Olympia.
- A typical dining experience at this museum could be at the museum's restaurant, which has an amazing view over Paris, with a dish such as "Duck Foie gras, green lentils and pickled onions".
- Other visitors can often be spotted sketching their own versions of the famous artwork or discussing the finer points of a piece.
- On your visit, you might cherish the moment when you're standing beside your beret-donned guide in front of Monet's 'Water Lilies', as he with his slightly accented English explains the transition from realistic to impressionistic art while the afternoon sun casts a warm glow through the glass ceiling of the former railway station, making the colors in the painting come to life.

Jardin des Tuileries: These historical gardens, perfectly manicured and filled with peaceful alcoves, lend themselves to dreamy contemplation. Ideally located near the Louvre Museum, your guide will lead you on a relaxing walk, revealing the centuries-old history behind this verdant oasis in the heart of Paris.

- The Tuileries Garden is a public garden located between the Louvre Museum and the Place de la Concorde in Paris.
- It was created by Catherine de Medici as the garden of the Tuileries Palace in 1564 and was opened to the public for the first time in 1667.
- During the French Revolution, the garden served as a place for festivals and public meetings. Later it became a promenade for the fashionable society.
- The garden has been a focal point in several literary works, such as "Les Misérables" by Victor Hugo and "Swann's Way" by Marcel Proust. The latter describes the garden's chestnut groves in bloom.
- People seen in the garden might be feeding ducks in the ponds, jogging along its tree-lined walks, or perhaps sunbathing or picnicking on the lawns.
- There are several cafes within the garden, providing a chance to taste a Parisian café-au-lait or a croissant while overlooking the beautiful fountains and lawns. The Angelina tearoom near the garden is particularly famous for its "Mont Blanc" pastry and its hot chocolate.
- Your tour guide, in his beret and with a twinkle in his eye, regales you with stories of the garden's past. As you stroll along the well-kept paths guided by his light French accent, he points out the various sculptures hidden in the foliage. A smile plays on his lips as a group of local school children dash past, giggling. "C'est la vie," he comments, embodying the Parisian appreciation for life's small moments. As you spot a squirrel darting up a nearby chestnut tree, he grins and says, "And that, mon ami, is one of the garden's elusive residents!" His lively narration makes historical facts come alive, turning your sightseeing tour into an unforgettable journey through time.
