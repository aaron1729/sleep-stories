My apologies for missing that. Here's your revised itinerary:

Central Park: A haven in the heart of the city, explore this sprawling park on an open-top bus for picturesque views of its lush landscape and charming features.

- Central Park is the first landscaped public park in the United States, open for public in 1858.
- Spanning over 843 acres, it features attractions like Strawberry Fields, Bethesda Fountain, and the Central Park Zoo.
- It served as an inspiration and setting for myriad works of literature and films, including Salinger's "Catcher in the Rye" and the film "Home Alone 2: Lost in New York".
- A must-try dining experience in Central Park is a picnic under the elm trees of Sheep Meadow.
- Visitors are often seen jogging, having a picnic, or taking a romantic boat ride in Central Park's lake.
  
On a sunny day, hop on an open-top bus, with the wind softly touching your face as a tour guide with a thick Brooklyn accent describes the landmarks scattered throughout the park. After the bus tour, take the Metro with the same guide, whose family stories weave a rich tapestry of New York history that is as captivating as the sights themselves. Imagine unfolding a map he lent you, tracing the green expanse with your finger, and marking the places you’ve been to and where you would love to go next. Looking outside the Metro windows, you see the Central Park's beauty passing by, like a silent movie in motion.

The Metropolitan Museum of Art: Delve into the world of art and history in this internationally acclaimed museum, home to over 5,000 years of world culture.

- The Metropolitan Museum of Art was opened in 1870, and was initially located at 681 Fifth Avenue.
- The institution hosts an impressive collection of over 2 million works encompassing everything from classic paintings to Egyptian mummies.
- One of the most famous pieces in the museum is an Egyptian temple, the Temple of Dendur, which was given to the United States by Egypt.
- The institution houses an important collection of European paintings and sculptures from artists such as Rembrandt, El Greco, Renoir, and Rodin.
- Eating at the Met is a refined experience -- the museum is home to several outstanding dining options, including The Dining Room, with views overlooking Central Park, and the more casual American Wing Café.
- On the museum steps, you might see people sketching the cityscape or engaging in lively conversation about the exhibitions they've seen.
- The Met is easily accessible by Metro -- when you exit at the 86th Street station, your tour guide, a hearty man with a thick Brooklyn accent, points up the street towards the large, imposing façade of the museum. He regales you with stories of his childhood trips to the museum, conveying his deep appreciation for the art within its walls and making you feel instantly connected to this bastion of culture in the heart of Manhattan.
- Outside on the grand steps, hundreds of people sit and chat, enjoying the view over Fifth Avenue. You join them, slowly eating a hot dog from one of the numerous street vendors, and feel the buzz of the city. Your tour guide narrates fascinating historical artefacts to you while you bask in the warm sun under the open-top bus, truly immersing yourself in the New York moment.
