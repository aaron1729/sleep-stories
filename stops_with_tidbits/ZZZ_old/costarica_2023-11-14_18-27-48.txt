Monteverde Cloud Forest Reserve: An ecotourism paradise, explore this unique habitat where the trees are perpetually shrouded in mist, giving it an ethereal, dreamlike quality.

- This reserve was established in 1972 and now covers approximately 26,000 acres.
- The Monteverde Cloud Forest Reserve is a haven for more than 500 bird species, 120 reptilian and amphibian species, and 130 mammal species.
- Authored by Leslie Holdridge in 1967, "Life Zone Ecology" played a major part in cultivating an understanding of the area's complex ecosystems and influencing the creation of the Monteverde Cloud Forest Reserve.
- A quote from biologist and naturalist Dr. E.O. Wilson: "A hundred years is too short for us to feel the sting of extinction. But careful direct studies and historical comparisons show that, once again, the extinction rate in the wild is proportional to the number of people and the amount of habitat destruction. In places like the Monteverde cloud forest of Costa Rica, where the increase has been as much as a hundred-fold, animals are disappearing hundreds of times faster than before the arrival of humans."
- Typical dining in Monteverde often involves locally grown coffee and gallo pinto, a traditional Costa Rican dish of rice and beans.
- Other tourists can be seen hiking the reserve’s trails, bird watching, and going on guided nature treks.
- A memorable experience of visiting the reserve by camper van would be pulling up as dawn breaks over the forest, the van’s headlights briefly mingling with the morning mist. As you step out, you feel the cool, damp air and breathe in the rich scent of damp earth and foliage. You hear the call of a distant bird and feel yourself surrounded by the tranquility and mystique of the forest. As the sun rises, you start your trek into the cloud forest, experiencing its beauty in the most intimate way.
