Ueno Park: A spacious public park in the Ueno district of Tokyo, filled with beautiful landscapes, several museums and a zoo. It offers an escape from the hustle and bustle of the city.

- Ueno Park was first opened to the public in 1873 and was one of Japan’s first public parks.
- This park is home to several major museums, including the Tokyo National Museum, the National Museum of Western Art, and Ueno Zoological Gardens, which is Japan's oldest zoo. 
- It is famous for its more than 1,000 cherry trees. Every year, between late March and early April, the park becomes one of Tokyo's most popular and lively cherry blossom viewing spots with people gathering for hanami, picnics under the blooming trees.
- “Ueno Park,” a short story by Rieko Matsuura, reflects on the social dynamics of the park, in particular, the homeless community that lives there.
- When visiting Ueno Park, one can often find vendors selling Takoyaki, a popular ball-shaped Japanese snack made of a wheat flour-based batter filled with diced octopus. This is a must-try experience. 
- Visitors to Ueno Park can often be seen enjoying a leisurely stroll beneath the cherry blossoms, picnicking, taking pictures of the stunning scenery, or enjoying a peaceful moment by Shinobazu Pond.
- A pleasant experience in visiting Ueno Park by Tokyo metro train starts with buying a ticket at the Ueno station, a major railway station in Tokyo's Taito ward. As you emerge from the station, your soft-spoken but knowledgeable guide might point out some landmarks - like the statue of Saigō Takamori, a famous samurai, sitting loyally with his dog by his side. Walking through the park, the guide might help you identify different cherry blossom tree varieties, sharing their historical significance in hushed tones. You might spend a sunny afternoon wandering the pathways, appreciating the natural beauty, feeding the park’s many pigeons, and ending the day with a cup of hot green tea at a nearby street vendor.

Tsukiji Outer Market: An open-air market associated with Tokyo's historic fish market, packed with food stalls selling all manners of seafood and culinary delights. A perfect spot to explore interesting local Japanese food.

- Tsukiji Outer Market was often referred to as "Tokyo's Pantry" due to the variety of food items found there.
- The market district was established around the same time as the Tsukiji Fish Market in 1935, serving as a food supply hub for Tokyo.
- A book called "Tsukiji: The Fish Market at the Center of the World" by Theodore C. Bestor details the rich, bustling life and history of the Tsukiji fish markets.
- One of the most popular dishes to have at the market is sushi, made with the freshest fish sourced right from the nearby fish market. Chirashi bowls (rice bowls with various top-quality sashimi) and grilled seafood skewers are other popular options.
- Other travelers can often be seen tasting a variety of street foods, photographing the array of colors and activities in the market, or simply strolling and doing a bit of shopping at the various non-food stalls.
- The experience of visiting the Tsukiji Outer Market via Tokyo metro and then on foot features a stark contrast. In the quiet, clean and efficient metro, the guide will softly but excitedly discuss the upcoming sensory explosion - the colors, smells, and tastes of the bustling outdoor market. Once there, although the guide won't need to raise his voice over the market's noise, his knowledge and enthusiasm will make every stand, every dish, and even every fish feel like a treasure.
