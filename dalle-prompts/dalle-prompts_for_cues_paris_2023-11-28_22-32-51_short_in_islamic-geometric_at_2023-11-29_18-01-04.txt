Generate an Islamic geometric pattern that mirrors the experience of viewing the Eiffel Tower from different angles as one glides along the Seine. The design should subtly depict the process of continual discovery, with a kaleidoscopic array of interlocking stars and polygons that transform perspective and morph to illustrate the varying facets of the tower. Employ a color scheme with the steel blues and grays of the metallic structure, greens, and soft pinks to reflect the springtime setting, and integrate dashes of sparkling golds and silvers to represent the sunlight and its reflections. Patterns should be intricate and multiply in complexity as they extend from the center, suggesting the endless unveiling of the tower's grandeur. Each segment of the pattern could subtly shift, representational of the changing views, but always maintaining a harmonious symmetry. The geometry should expertly weave together without direct figurative imagery, evoking a sense of movement and the serene advance of the riverboat in a manner befitting the spiritual and aesthetic principles of Islamic art.
